# Adaptive-Filters-Presentation
A presentation made on a reading project of Adaptive Filter Design.  
This presentation goes over what an adaptive filter is, the history and its origin and its need in the current world of signal processing.  
It also goes over its application in echo removal, FM radio signal decoding (specifically, in channel noise/error estimation) and noise cancellation.  
Then the training techniques behind an adaptive filter are seen, which includes baby gradient descent, Least Mean Squares technique and also Recursive Least Mean Squares techinique
